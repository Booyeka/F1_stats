# F1_stats
Formula 1 stat collection and data visualization


This repo is meant to be a personal project using the FASTF1 python library to collect the various stats involved in Free practices.

This will serve to be another project focused on creating and maintaing a SQL database to further my skills in that area, as well as visualizing the data within it to create some insights as well as just for fun.
